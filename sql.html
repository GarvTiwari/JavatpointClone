                SQL Tutorial 
            </div>
            <div class="mar-0">
                SQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Our SQL tutorial is designed for both beginners and professionals.
                <br>

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database, such as updating records, inserting records, deleting records, creating and modifying database tables, views, etc.
<br>
SQL is not a database system, but it is a query language.
<br>
Suppose you want to perform the queries of SQL language on the stored data in the database. You are required to install any database management system in your systems, for example, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, DB2, etc
            </div>

                What is SQL?
            </div>
            <div class="mar-0">
                SQL is a short-form of the structured query language, and it is pronounced as S-Q-L or sometimes as See-Quell.
                <br>

This database language is mainly designed for maintaining the data in relational database management systems. It is a special tool used by data professionals for handling structured data (data which is stored in the form of tables). It is also designed for stream processing in RDSMS.
<br>

You can easily create and manipulate the database, access and modify the table rows and columns, etc. This query language became the standard of ANSI in the year of 1986 and ISO in the year of 1987.
<br>

If you want to get a job in the field of data science, then it is the most important query language to learn. Big enterprises like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, use SQL for storing the data in the back-end.

                History of  SQL?
            </div>
            <div class="mar-0">
                "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" was a paper which was published by the great computer scientist "E.F. Codd" in 1970.
                <br>

The IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin originally developed the SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) after learning from the paper given by E.F. Codd. They both developed the SQL at the San Jose Research laboratory of IBM Corporation in 1970.
<br>

At the end of the 1970s, relational software Inc. developed their own first SQL using the concepts of E.F. Codd, Raymond Boyce, and Donald Chamberlin. This SQL was totally based on RDBMS. Relational Software Inc., which is now known as Oracle Corporation, introduced the Oracle V2 in June 1979, which is the first implementation of SQL language. This Oracle V2 version operates on VAX computers.

            <div class="las-color st-1"> 
            Process  of  SQL?
            </div>
            <div class="mar-0">
                When we are executing the command of SQL on any Relational database management system, then the system automatically finds the best routine to carry out our request, and the SQL engine determines how to interpret that particular command.
                <br>

                 Structured Query Language contains the following four components in its process:
                 <br>
            </div>
            <div class="mar-1">
                <ul>
                   <li>
                    Query Dispatcher
                 </li>
                   <li>   
                    Classic Query Engine
                 </li>
                   <li> SQL Query Engine, etc.</li>
                 
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="mar-0">
                A classic query engine allows data professionals and users to maintain non-SQL queries. The architecture of SQL is shown in the following diagram:

            <div class="mar-0">
                The SQL commands help in creating and managing the database. The most common SQL commands which are highly used are mentioned below:
